## Overview

This project uses Python to analyze and predict earthquake occurrences based on historical data. It includes various machine learning models and techniques to forecast potential seismic activities. The repository provides scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cedamusk/earthquake-prediction-using-Python.git
cd earthquake-prediction-using-Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start by running the main script to train and evaluate the models. The project includes several scripts for different stages of the workflow:

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for preprocessing the earthquake data.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training machine learning models.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Script for evaluating model performance.
- `predict_earthquakes.py`: Script for making predictions with the trained models.

To train the model, execute:

```bash
python model_training.py
```

To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```

## Data

The project uses historical earthquake data, which can be downloaded from [source](#). Place the data file in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data is in the required format as specified in `data_preprocessing.py`.

## Models

This repository includes several models for earthquake prediction:

- **Model A**: Description and parameters.
- **Model B**: Description and parameters.
- **Model C**: Description and parameters.

Refer to `model_training.py` for details on model configuration and training.
